/*
Given a matrix representing a tic-tac-toe board, determine whether someone won, whether it
was a tie, or whether the game has not ended yet.3
Here are some examples.
Here, X won:
OX-
-XO
OX
Here it is as a matrix: [['O', 'X', '-'], ['-' ,'X', 'O'], ['O', 'X', '-']].
Here, O won:
O-X
-O-
-XO
Here it is as a matrix: [['O','-','X'], ['-','O','-'], ['-','X','O']].
To do this, check all three rows using a for loop, check all columns using a for loop, and
check diagonals.

\n is the set of characters used to break a line in JavaScript, like in many standard
programming languages. Combining it with backticks, you can create line breaks during the
variable-to-string assignment.

/*
Rotate a matrix to the left by 90 degrees.
For example, the following:

101
001
111

rotates to this:

111
001
101
