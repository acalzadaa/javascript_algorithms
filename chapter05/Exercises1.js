/*
FIND TWO ARRAY ELEMENTS IN AN ARRAY THAT ADD UP TO A NUMBER

Problem: Given the array arr, find and return two indices of the array that add up to weight
or return -1 if there is no combination that adds up to weight.
For example, in an array like [1,2,3,4,5], what numbers add up to 9?
The answers are 4 and 5, of course.

/*
IMPLEMENT THE ARRAY.SLICE() FUNCTION FROM SCRATCH

Let’s review what the .slice() function does.
.slice() takes two parameters: the beginning index and the last ending index of the array.
It returns a portion of an existing array without modifying the array function arraySlice
(array, beginIndex, endIndex).

/*
FIND THE MEDIAN OF TWO SORTED ARRAYS OF THE SAME SIZE

Recall that median in an even number of a set is the average of the two middle numbers.
If the array is sorted, this is simple.
Here’s an example:
[1,2,3,4] has the median of (2+3)/2 = 2.5.
