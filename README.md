# Javascript Data Structures and Algorithms

This project consist in a major training in Data Structures and Algorithms specifically using Javascript, I used the book "Javascript Data Structures and Algorithms" (Bae, Sammy. Javascript Data Structures and Algorithms, Apress, 2019) as a guide for this. The main goal is to gain an advanced insight of the quirks and features of javascript

Pause in chapter 10, continue with "Javascript Next" then "Javascript The New Toys", and then return to finish this book.
